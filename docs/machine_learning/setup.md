## Setup 

For the following machine learning tutorials we will be using glioblastoma data from [cBioPortal](https://www.cbioportal.org/study/summary?id=gbm_cptac_2021). When working within R it is useful to set up an R project. R projects will set your working directory relative to the project directory. This can help ensure you are only working with files within this project space. To create a new project:
    
1. Go to `File` > `New Project`
2. `New Directory`
3. `New Project`
4. Create a name for your project (e.g. `machine_learning`)
5. `Create Project`
     
When analyzing data it is useful to create a folder to house your raw data, scripts and results. We can do this by clicking the `New Folder` icon to create these folders:

1. Click `New Folder` > Enter `data` > Click OK
2. Click `New Folder` > Enter `scripts` > Click OK
3. Click `New Folder` > Enter `results` > Click OK
    
Now that we have our project set up we will need to download our data. In the `data` folder we will download our data and decompress it:

``` R
download.file(url = "https://cbioportal-datahub.s3.amazonaws.com/gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz",destfile = "./data/gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz" )
untar(tarfile = "./data/gbm_cptac_2021.tar.gz",exdir = "./data/")
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter a timeout error you can manually set the timeout to longer than the standard 60 seconds:

```R
options(timeout = 9000000000000000000)
```
